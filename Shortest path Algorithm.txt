1. Define structures for "Edge" and "Node" to represent graph edges and nodes respectively.
2. Implement Dijkstra's algorithm in the function dijkstra to find the shortest path from a source
node to all other nodes:
    • Initialize distances to all nodes as infinity except the source node, which is set to 0.
    • Use a priority queue to explore nodes with the shortest distances first.
    • Update distances if a shorter path is found.
3. In the 'main' function:
    • Prompt the user to input the number of nodes and edges.
    • Create a graph data structure and input edges from the user.
    • Prompt the user to input the source node for shortest path calculation.
    • Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest distances from the source node to all other nodes.
    • Output the shortest distances from the source node to all other nodes.
